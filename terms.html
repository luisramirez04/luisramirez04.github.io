<p>4. The Realist Services A. Posting Items, Buying and Selling The Realist Services allow you to post items for sale by uploading pictures and providing item descriptions. You can post most items through the Services without charge. Realist charges a fee to post some items, for example,if you exceed your available free posts for certain types of items in certain categories. For more information on how and when fees are charged, see below.</p>

<p>When a buyer and seller agree on a price for an item posted for sale on the Services there are several options for completing the transaction.</p>

<p>If a buyer and seller agree, items may be paid for in-person and outside of the Realist Services, such as by cash, check or other agreed upon payment methods. The details of such a transaction and their payments are made directly between the buyer and the seller when they complete their transaction, pursuant to terms they determine. Realist is not a party to such transactions in any way, does not facilitate such transactions, and cannot assist with refunds or returns related to such transactions in any manner. Since Realist is not a party or involved in transactions of this nature, you acknowledge we cannot be held liable for any claims that arise out of it.</p>

<p>B. Posting Jobs The Realist Services allow businesses to post job openings for a fee, which shall be determined solely by Realist and may vary according to your location, length of job posting, etc. Realist Jobs postings are only available for employment at businesses, not by individuals at this time, and only for positions based within the United States.

Identity Verification Feature We partner with Stripe, a third party service, to process identifications.

By Verifying your identity, you must read and accept Stripe Privacy Policy and Stripe Terms of Service.</p>

<p>The ability to post an item or contact a seller indicates only that a user has provided Realist with the requested documentation.

<p>21. Dispute Resolution; Binding Arbitration Please read the following section carefully because it requires you to arbitrate certain disputes and claims with Realist and limits the manner in which you can seek relief from us, unless you opt out of arbitration by following the instructions set forth below. No class or representative actions or arbitrations are allowed under this arbitration agreement. In addition, arbitration precludes you from suing in court or having a jury trial.</p>

<p>No Representative Actions. You and Realist agree that any dispute arising out of or related to these Terms or our Services is personal to you and Realist, and that any dispute will be resolved solely through individual action, and will not be brought as a class arbitration, class action or any other type of representative proceeding. The limitations imposed by this section apply to, but are in no way limited to, class action refund claims brought by a class of taxpayers against Realist related to taxes collected and remitted in good faith efforts at compliance with state and local marketplace facilitator or marketplace provider laws. Nothing in this section will be construed to prohibit a buyer from filing a refund claim with the seller or applicable state and local tax authority as permitted by law.</p>

<p>Arbitration of Disputes. Except for small claims disputes in which you or Realist seeks to bring an individual action in small claims court located in the county of your billing address or disputes in which you or Realist seeks injunctive or other equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use of intellectual property, you and Realist waive your rights to a jury trial and to have any dispute arising out of or related to these Terms or our Services resolved in court. Instead, for any dispute or claim that you have against Realist or relating in any way to the Services, you agree to first contact Realist and attempt to resolve the claim informally by sending a written notice of your claim (&quot;Notice&quot;) to Realist by email at help.realist@gmail.com.</p>

<p>The Notice must (a) include your name, your residence address, your email address, your telephone number, and, if you have registered for an Realist account, the email address your account is registered under if it is different from your current email address; (b) your Realist account username; (c) a description of the nature and basis of the claim; (d) details on the specific Realist item or transaction in question; and (e) set forth the specific relief sought. Our notice to you will be similar in form to that described above. If you and Realist cannot reach an agreement to resolve the claim within thirty (30) days after such Notice is received, then either party may submit the dispute to binding arbitration administered by JAMS or, under the limited circumstances set forth above, in court. All disputes submitted to JAMS will be resolved through confidential, binding arbitration before one arbitrator. Arbitration proceedings will be held in Boca Raton, Florida unless you are a consumer, in which case you may elect to hold the arbitration at the JAMS office closest to your residence. For purposes of this Section 21, a &quot;consumer&quot; means a person using the Services for personal, family or household purposes. Additionally, arbitrations may be conducted telephonically or via video conference for disputes alleging damages less than $10,000. You and Realist agree that arbitrations will be held in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures (&quot;JAMS Rules&quot;). The most recent version of the JAMS Rules are available on the JAMS website and are hereby incorporated by reference. You either acknowledge and agree that you have read and understand the JAMS Rules or waive your opportunity to read the JAMS Rules and waive any claim that the JAMS Rules are unfair or should not apply for any reason.</p>

<p>You and Realist agree that these Terms affect interstate commerce and that the enforceability of this Section 21 will be substantively and procedurally governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. &sect; 1, et seq. (the &quot;FAA&quot;), to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law. As limited by the FAA, these Terms and the JAMS Rules, the arbitrator will have exclusive authority to make all procedural and substantive decisions regarding any dispute and to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court, including the power to determine whether a dispute may be arbitrated. The arbitrator may conduct only an individual arbitration and may not consolidate more than one individual's claims, preside over any type of class or representative proceeding or preside over any proceeding involving more than one individual.</p>

<p>The arbitration will allow for the discovery or exchange of non-privileged information relevant to the dispute. The arbitrator, Realist, and you will maintain the confidentiality of any arbitration proceedings, judgments and awards, including, but not limited to, all information gathered, prepared and presented for purposes of the arbitration or related to the dispute(s) therein. The arbitrator will have the authority to make appropriate rulings to safeguard confidentiality, unless the law provides to the contrary. The duty of confidentiality does not apply to the extent that disclosure is necessary to prepare for or conduct the arbitration hearing on the merits, in connection with a court application for a preliminary remedy or in connection with a judicial challenge to an arbitration award or its enforcement, or to the extent that disclosure is otherwise required by law or judicial decision.</p>

<p>You and Realist agree that for any arbitration you initiate, you will pay the filing fee and Realist will pay the remaining JAMS fees and costs. For any arbitration initiated by Realist, Realist will pay all JAMS fees and costs. You and Realist agree that the state or federal courts of the State of Florida and the United States sitting in Boca Raton, Florida have exclusive jurisdiction over any appeals and the enforcement of an arbitration award.</p>

<p>Any claim arising out of or related to these Terms or our Services must be filed within one year after such claim arose; otherwise, the claim is permanently barred, which means that you and Realist will not have the right to assert the claim.</p>

<p>You have the right to opt out of binding arbitration within 30 days of the date you first accepted the terms of this Section 21 by emailing Realist at help.realist@gmail.com.</p>

<p>In order to be effective, the opt-out notice must include your full name and address and clearly indicate your intent to opt out of binding arbitration. By opting out of binding arbitration, you are agreeing to resolve disputes in accordance with Section 23.</p>

<p>If any portion of this Section 21 is found to be unenforceable or unlawful for any reason, (a) the unenforceable or unlawful provision shall be severed from these Terms; (b) severance of the unenforceable or unlawful provision shall have no impact whatsoever on the remainder of this Section 21 or the parties' ability to compel arbitration of any remaining claims on an individual basis pursuant to this Section 21; and (c) to the extent that any claims must therefore proceed on a class, collective, consolidated, or representative basis, such claims must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration, and the parties agree that litigation of those claims shall be stayed pending the outcome of any individual claims in arbitration. Further, if any part of this Section 21 is found to prohibit an individual claim seeking public injunctive relief, that provision will have no effect to the extent such relief is allowed to be sought out of arbitration, and the remainder of this Section 21 will be enforceable. If you are a consumer, the provisions of this Section 21 will be modified to the extent necessary to conform to the JAMS Consumer Arbitration Minimum Standards.</p>

<p>23.
